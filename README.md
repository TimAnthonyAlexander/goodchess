This chess is better than badchess.


## Installation:

### Self-learning

The engine can play against itself with a greater depth and greater search time to build a stronger database.
In order for the engine to perform better, you can run 

``` php databasefiller.php ```

and keep it running for a while.
It will speed up the interactive version.

### Interactive version

Start the php server like so:

``` php -S 127.0.0.1:80 -t ```

in the root repository directory. You can then open up http://127.0.0.1 in your browser.
You are free to use a different port if you want to.
